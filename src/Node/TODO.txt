1. REVIEW THE LIST OF NODES UNDER REVIEW.txt
    - it is imperitive we decide on a behaviour for the AST Visitor
      before hand, should the accept function detail what order to visit the ndoes?
      or should it be the ASTVisitor's visit function which decides what to visit
      next. I think the latter will be easier to program and it also means
      editing less classes under Node/*

1. Create accept methods for every single node.
    - the most basic of these methods should just call v->visit(this)
    - however we need to work out the logic for calling children on certain
      nodes. vs just using local paramaters.
