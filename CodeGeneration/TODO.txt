*1. Decide on how the visitor will pass-back / create the machine code.
        - perhaps we just have a string/stringstream in each concrete visitor
          which we just concat too with <<  and create a public getprogram()
          which just returns that string?

	  	- Decided on two stringstreams
		- DATA and PROGRAM
		- get program just assembles both
2. Implement visit() for all node types.
		- WIP
3. Implement weight() functions for every node.

4. Implement Register saving for each visit function.
	
5. implement some basic peephole optimisation.
		-> LOOOOOLL

6. Implement fileio for the finished program string
		- this is basically done
		- just need to make a bash script


7. EXTENSION
        - we need to decide what we are going to do!!!
        - Creatinga cross compiler:
                    - MIPS
                    - ARMv5/6 
        - Optimisations
