1. Decide on how the visitor will pass-back / create the machine code.
        - perhaps we just have a string/stringstream in each concrete visitor
          which we just concat too with <<  and create a public getprogram()
          which just returns that string?
2. Implement visit() for all node types.
3. implement some basic peephole optimisation.
4. Implement fileio for the finished program string

5 test with as and ld


6. EXTENSION:
        - we need to decide what we are going to do!!!
        - Creatinga cross compiler:
                    - MIPS
                    - ARMv5/6 
        - Optimisations
