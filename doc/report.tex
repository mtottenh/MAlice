\section{The Product}
%TODO - Probably needs expanding, it's not even 1 page long...
The compiler the group has produced takes code written in the MAlice language
and produces x86-64 assembly code, as well as calling \emph{nasm} and \emph{gcc}
to produce an executable binary. Additionally, as part of the extension, an
assembly file with extension \texttt{.arm} is produced that can be assembled
to run on an ARM processor.

The group ensured at every stage of development that the product produced
was functionally correct and matched the specification. After completion of
Milestone 2, the parser and semantic analysis components were tested against
all test cases, as well as some custom written test files, to ensure invalid
code raised the appropriate error messages. After completion of Milestone 3, it
was also ensured that the assembly code produced led to the correct result 
for all test cases, with the group fixing bugs and issues where appropriate.

Due to decisions made in regard to design, discussed further in the next
section, the group ensured the product performed effeciently. The language
choice for the project, C++, helps to promote such effeciency, and the group
also made an effort to prevent memory leaks and free memory where required. 
Additionally, for each data structure used, the team considered what would be
best for the situation, such as choosing between a \emph{std::vector} or a
\emph{std::deque}. Finally, we made use of design patterns such as the visitor
pattern to aid further extensions and provide a solid base for future work.

\section{The Design Choices}

\subsection{Language Choice - C++}
% TODO - Maybe expand on this?
The majority of the project was implemented using the C++ language. This
decision was made due to many advantages C++ offers - most of the speed and
effeciency of the C language with the addition of useful data structures such
as \emph{std::deque}s. The group did consider other languages, such as Java (as
recommended in the specification), but decided that the benefits of speed and
low level operations outweighed Java's advantages (e.g. garbage collection) in
this instance.

\subsection{Flex and Bison}

When implementation began during Milestone 2, the group carefully considered
many options for lexical analysis and parser generation. The choice for making 
use of tools for this milestone was made due to the difficulty associated with
creating a parser generator for an LALR grammar. After looking at the
pros and cons of many packages, \emph{Flex} was chosen for lexical analysis
and \emph{Bison} chosen as the parser generator. This decision was made as 
these two packages are arguably the most stable and well documented tools for 
aiding in the creation of a compiler front end.

\subsection{Code Generation - Visitor Pattern}

For the code generation stage of the project, the visitor pattern was used, 
seperating the logic of code generation from the nodes contained within the
abstract syntax tree. For the generation of x86-64 code, the \texttt{x86Visitor}
class calls \texttt{accept} on the root node of the abstract syntax tree, which
in turn calls the the visitor's \texttt{visit} on its children, and so on, 
generating code for each node in order. 

To support future development, \texttt{x86Visitor} implements an interface,
\texttt{ASTVisitor}. As part of the extension, the \texttt{ARMVisitor} class was
created that also implements this interface. The use of the visitor pattern
made creating this additional visitor quick and easy - and due to the lessons
learnt from \texttt{x86Visitor}, the \texttt{ARMVisitor} becamse mostly a
matter of translating syntax from x86-64 to ARM. Additional visitors, for other
assembly languages, would also be made easier through this design pattern.

\subsection{Linking with the C Standard Library}
%TODO - Are we using malloc() for arrays?
In order to simplify the process of accepting user input and to print data to
\texttt{stdout}, the MAlice compiler links to the C standard library to make 
use of the \texttt{printf} and \texttt{scanf} functions. This decision was made
to reduce implementation time for these functions and avoid using 
platform-specific system calls, which would reduce code portability. 

Additionally, at the end of a MAlice assembly program, the C \texttt{exit} 
method is called rather than an exit system call. This ensures that 
\texttt{stdout} and \texttt{stderr} correctly have their buffers cleared at the
end of execution of the MAlice program.

\subsection{Future Work}

Although the group considered very heavily the design and how classes would
interact throughout Milestone 3, more could have been done during Milestone 2.
The group was perhaps a little too quick to begin writing code without 
considering how classes and objects would interact, and this led to the team 
running into problems that cost time. A future improvement to increase 
productivity would be to draw UML diagrams or class diagrams and to write
pseudocode in order to identify design issues before they occur in code.

Moreover, further consideration could be given to how MAlice stores data. 
Currently, for ease of code generation in x86-64, all variables are given
64 bits of storage, regardless of whether the variable contains a character,
number, or string. This is wasteful of memory at runtime. Additionally, in the
ARM extension (again, for ease of code generation), all variables are given
32 bits of storage. This introduces inconsistencies that may hinder a MAlice
developer who chose to use our compiler.

Finally, a potential area for future improvement could be to make use of
\emph{LLVM}. The use of this tool would allow the group to produce highly
optimised assembly code beyond the simple optimisations completed in the time
available. The use of LLVM would also give the group experience in a tool that
would likely be used in industry in compiler creation.

\section{Beyond the Specification}

\subsection{Optimisations}
%TODO - What optimisations did we implement? For those we didn't, why not?

\subsection{ARM Code Generation}

For the extension, the group decided to compile MAlice programs into ARM
assembly code in addition to x86-64 code. This would allow MAlice developers
to theoretically write code that would run on a wide variety of additional
devices, such as Android smartphones and tablets. As discussed previously, 
a new class, \texttt{ARMVisitor}, was created that implements the interface
\texttt{ASTVisitor}.

After the x86-64 code has been generated and assembled, the same abstract syntax
tree will be used with the \texttt{ARMVisitor} class, resulting in ARM assembly
code. However, unlike as with the x86-64 code generation step, the ARM code is
not assembled or linked with the C standard library, due to the lack of tools
available for this on the standard lab machine install. Despite this, members
of the group installed the \texttt{arm-linux-gnueabihf} (providing versions of
\emph{gcc} and \emph{as} for ARM) and \texttt{qemu-user} (providing a user mode
ARM emulator) packages on their local machines. Using these tools, it was
verified that the ARM code produced was functionally correct and passed all
test cases.

\subsection{Future Work: C Library Functions}

One extension that would make MAlice a much more powerful language for 
developers would be to introduce a language construct that allows a developer 
to call C library methods. For example, this would allow developers to use 
things such as file I/O, which are not supported natively in MAlice. Since 
MAlice code is already linked with the C standard library upon compilation
(as mentioned earlier, for \texttt{printf}, \texttt{scanf} and \texttt{exit}),
it would be relatively easy to implement this extension if additional time
were available.
