arrSize was a number of 15.
arr had arrSize number.

The room binarySearch (number key) contained a number
opened
  low was a number, high was a number, mid was a number.
  low became 0.
  high became arrSize - 1.
  eventually (low > high) because
     mid became (low + high) / 2.
     perhaps (arr's mid piece > key) so
       high became mid - 1.
     or maybe (arr's mid piece < key) so
       low became mid + 1.

   toFind was a number.
   
   The looking-glass search ()
   opened
     result was a number and result became binarySearch(toFind).
     perhaps (result != 0) so
       "Found " spoke and toFind spoke and " in array\n" spoke.

       "Unable to find " spoke and toFind spoke and " in array\n" spoke.

   i was a number of 0.
   eventually (i == arrSize) because
     arr's i piece became i + (i-1)/2.
