\section{Introduction}

The goal of this document is to outline an informal language specification for 
the programming language MAlice. The following sections will outline the rough
gramatical structure of the language in Pseudo-Extended-BNF (PSEBNF). 

\section{BNF Grammar} 

\begin{verbatim}
    - Malice Language Structure - 
    Function    = String ,  "()" ,  "opened" , Codeblock , "closed" ;
    Exp         = Exp '+' Term | Exp '-' Term | Term ;
    Term        = Term '*' Factor | Term '/' Factor | Factor ;
    Factor      = '~' Value | Value ;
    Value       = Integer | Identifier ;
    Type        = "number" | "letter" ;
    Declare     = "was a" , Type ;
    Assign      = "became" , Exp | "became" , Char ;
    Return      = "said Alice" ;
    Code        = Identifier , Declare | Identifier , Assign | Exp , Return ;
    Codeblock   = Code , Separator , Codeblock | Code , Terminator ; 
    Separator   = Terminator | ',' | "and" | "but" ; 
    Identifier  = String ;
    Terminator  = "too." | '.' | ',' ;
    

   - Primitives -
    String      = { Char } ;
    Integer     = '0' | [ '-' ] , Nat ;
    Nat         = DigitNoZero , { Digit } ;
    Digit       = '0' | DigitNoZero ; 
    DigitNoZero =  '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' ;
    Char        = 'a' | 'b' | 'c' | 'd' | 'e' | 'f' | 'g' | 'h' | 'i' | 'j' | 'k' 
                | 'l' | 'm' | 'n' | 'o' | 'p' | 'q' | 'r' | 's' | 't' | 'u' | 'v'
                | 'w' | 'x' | 'y' | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'E' | 'F' | 'G'
                | 'H' | 'I' | 'J' | 'K' | 'L' | 'M' | 'N' | 'O' | 'P' | 'Q' | 'R'
                | 'S' | 'T' | 'U' | 'V' | 'W' | 'X' | 'Y' | 'Z' ;
 
\end{verbatim}

\section{Semantics}

\subsection{Data Types}

\subsubsection{\texttt{number}}
{\bf Range:} +127 to -128 {\bf Memory required:} 8 bits.
 
\tab This data type is similar to the \texttt{int} data type from other 
programming languages, or a subset of integers from mathematics. In the Alice 
language, \texttt{number}s are represented in 8 bit two's complement - this
means they have a range from +127 to -128. The choice to have \texttt{number}s
represented in two's complement was derived from the sample functions whereby
all \texttt{number}s used fell within the +127 to -128 range. Additionally, when
operations such as bitwise NOT were performed, the result suggested that the 
\texttt{number}s were represented in two's complement format.

\subsubsection{\texttt{letter}}

{\bf Range:} a-z, A-Z {\bf Memory required:} 8 bits.

\tab This data type is similar to the \texttt{char} data type from other
programming languages, representing a letter or character. Note that this type
is somewhat restricted in the range of characters that can be represented; Alice
only supports lower and upper-case letters (a-z and A-Z). This range was deduced
from the sample functions whereby no numbers or other characters were used in
\texttt{letter}s. A \texttt{letter} is stored in 8 bits using ASCII 
representation. The allocation of 8 bits for a \texttt{letter} also allows for
potential expansion for other characters, such as numbers and other symbols 
(such as \$).

Also note that the Alice language does not support a \texttt{string} data 
type, as Alice does not support arrays (and hence could not store an array of
characters or \texttt{letter}s).

\subsection{Operator Precedence}
The operators in Alice are defined below in increasing order of operator precidence.

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	$|$ Defines the logical bitwise OR operator. 
	\\ \tab e.g. 3 $|$ 5 = 7
	\item
	$\land$ Defines the logical bitwise XOR operator. 
	\\ \tab e.g. 3 $\land$ 5 = 6
	\item
	$\&$ Defines the logical bitwise AND operator. 
	\\ \tab e.g. 3 $\&$ 5 = 1
	\item
	+ - Define Integer Addition and Subtration respectively. 
	\\ \tab e.g. 3 + 5 = 8 \\ \tab e.g. 3 - 5 = -2
	\item
	* / \% Define Integer Multiplication, Division, and Modulo respectively. 
	\\ \tab e.g. 3 * 5 = 15 \\ \tab e.g. 3 / 5 = 0 \\ \tab e.g. 3 \% 5 = 3
	\item
	\textasciitilde  Defines the unary logical NOT operator.
	\\ \tab e.g. \textasciitilde$ 3 = -4$
\end{itemize}

\section{TODO}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item
    Figure out opperator precidence
    
    \item
    Make sure the gammar is left recursive
    
    \item
    Finish PSEBNF spec

    \item
    Use BNF with Scanning techniques 
    
    \item
     explain operators

    \item
    Explain legal operations    
    
    
\end{enumerate}

And here is a bulleted list.

\begin{itemize}

    \item
    The parts of the list are called items here too.
    
\end{itemize}

Finally for this document, if you want to include a reference
then you put it into a \texttt{thebibliography\{...\}}
environment (see below in source file) and then 
cite it like this \cite{lamport94}
(you will need to run \texttt{latex} twice to get it to process the citation),
or you can use BibTex but that is probably overkill for now.
